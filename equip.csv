1,GRENADE X3,SMALL,2,VIOLENCE + 3,"Blows up in a pretty wide radius five seconds after you \npress the arming button. You could probably modify it \nto explode on a timer, or a trigger, but you should be \nvery careful with that sort of thing."
2,THE MINIGUN,LARGE,3,VIOLENCE + 1,That's a misleading name; this thing is bloody huge. \nFires D6 times before it runs out of ammo; get the GM \nto roll. You can't tell how many shots you've got left \nunless you take it apart.
3,SNIPER RIFLE,MEDIUM,2,VIOLENCE + 4,"If you try to use it when you've not had time to \nprepare and calibrate the thing, those bonus dice \nbecome negative dice."
4,MULTI-ADAPTOR,SMALL,1,MECHANICS +0,"If there's a lot of things that need to be recharged \nand only one power outlet, you're the most popular \nTroubleshooter in the team."
5,GAUSS ROCKET LAUNCHER,LARGE,3,VIOLENCE +0,Either this weapon uses electromagnets to launch \nexplosive projectiles up to 300 metres (3 charges) or \nit fires gauss rockets. Information on gauss rockets is \nclassified at your security level.
6,GRAPPLE GUN,MEDIUM,2,MECHANICS + 2,"Uses compressed gas to shoot a grapnel attached to a \nsteel cable; very useful for climbing, swinging or rapidly \ndescending. Could be used as a Level 1 weapon, with the \nadditional benefit (or problem) that on a successful hit you are \nnow attached to your target."
7,BODY ARMOUR,LARGE,2,ATHLETICS -2,"Increases the wearer's defence rating by 2. Makes \nhydraulic noises. Has a habit of coming off, breaking \nor running out of power at inopportune moments (or \ncritical failures)."
8,MEDKIT X3,SMALL,1,BRAINS + 2,Whack one on a wound and watch it insta-heal! Isn't \nnanotechnology and morphine great? Some medkits \nwill even regrow a missing limb. You weren't missing a \nlimb? Now you have a spare! Make a Brains + Science \ncheck to use properly.
9,ELECTRO KNUCKLES,SMALL,1,VIOLENCE + 3,Add a die when you punch someone or intimidate \nthem and another dice if you want to electrocute \nthem at the same time (4 charges).
10,SEDATIVES X3,SMALL,1,BRAINS + 1,"Used to calm down unstable clones, whether they're \ninnocent bystanders, dangerous terrorists or misguided \nmembers of the Troubleshooter team. Make a Brains + \nScience check to inflict calm."
11,DATA BOMB,MEDIUM,3,MECHANICS + 2,Renders the immediate area free of all electronic activity \nfor 1-3 minutes and makes it easier to mess with machines \nand computers. Usable only once.

12,TAXI-POD,OVERSIZE,2,MECHANICS + 2,A small electric four-wheeled vehicle suitable for carrying \nup to four small Troubleshooters with no equipment or \nintimacy issues or one larger Troubleshooter with a lot of \nequipment. Range depends on load.

14,NEEDLER,MEDIUM,1,VIOLENCE +4,Fires small hypodermic darts up to 15 metres. \nStandard darts contain a strong knockout drug\n (takes effect in 1-2 rounds) but other darts are \navailable.
15,FRICTION ENHANCER,LARGE,4,BRAINS +4,"This experimental device increases or reduces friction by up to \n500%. Requires a Science roll to operate correctly. Increasing \nfriction causes solids to move less freely and machinery to \nseize up; reducing it makes everything slippery and difficult \nto hold, while machines run faster. Only works while trigger \nis pressed. Power pack weighs 65kg and discharges in 20 \nseconds; can be recharged (8 hours) or replaced. Range: a \n30-degree beam, up to 15 metres."
16,LASER TRIPWIRE,MEDIUM,3,MECHANICS +1,"A brick-sized box that attaches to any flat surface. \nWhen armed it projects an invisible laser beam up \nto 10 metres that detects and slices through anyone \npassing through it like cheesewire.

17,FOAM GRENADE X3,SMALL,2,VIOLENCE +2,"This grenade creates 30 cubic metres of grey sticky foam that \nsolidifies in 2 combat rounds, immobilising anyone caught in \nit. Make a Violence + Melee roll to get free before it sets; no \nchance after that. Anyone completely covered will suffocate \nin 1-3 minutes. Foam does not burn, cannot be lasered \nand R&D is developing a solution that will dissolve it without \ndissolving clones trapped in it. \n"
18,K@ COMPANION BOT,MEDIUM,3,MECHANICS +5,"A feline surveillance bot, K@ can climb walls, explore confined \nspaces, or lie on watch, all while streaming live audio/video \nto the Troubleshooter's Cerebral Coretech. Uses titanium \nteeth and claws to attack or sabotage. Has night-vision and a \n12-hour battery. If its cats-whisker wifi antennae are damaged \nmake a Mechanics + Operate roll or the bot enters â€˜feral' \nmode and must be recaptured. K@ bots see other K@s as \nhostile and are distracted by lasers."
19,HYGIENE-O-MATIC 9000,LARGE,3,MECHANICS +2,"Clean corridors! Clean your friends! Wash propaganda out \nof a traitor's mouth! Comes with five solutions for all your \nhygiene needs. To use, make a Mechanical + Science roll \n(Violence + Science in combat) to choose a setting. On a fail \nthe GM chooses but that setting is then empty. Settings are: \nCombination Soap, Shampoo, and Mouth Wash; Industrial \nSolvent and Paint Stripper; Pure Bleach; No-Mess Sanitation \nGel (flammable); and Quick-Dry Superglue for Fast Repairs."
20,U.B.T. HYPERSENSE DEVICE,SMALL,2,BRAINS +4,"The UBT Hypersense Device digitally enhances one \nof the Troubleshooter's senses by a factor of 12 by \nrepurposing the bandwidth of the other senses and \nreducing their input. Make an Brains + Operate roll to \nuse successfully. Synaesthesia and disorientation can \nresult, as well as a spackle of grey itchings bitter with \nthe eleven of hair."
21,CASEY-B'S BOMBABOOTS,MEDIUM,3,VIOLENCE +5,"The ultimate in personal manoeuvrability!

Do not stand within two Metres of user."
22,FAKE MOUSTACHE,SMALL,1,CHUTZPAH +4,"Working undercover? Worried that terrorists know your \nface? Worry no more! Fake Moustache lets you reclaim your \nanonymity. No one's looking for a clone with a moustache! \nPlace it under your nose, let the pneumatic pinchers expand \nwithin your nostrils and feel like a new clone. Fake Moustache \nidentifies the wearer as John-R-DOE-1 (default setting) to all \nCerebral Coretech users and bots. Only the Computer knows \nyour secret."
