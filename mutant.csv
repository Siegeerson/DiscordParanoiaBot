TELEPATHY,7,"Spend 1 Moxie to read one dominant \nthought or implant a simple \nsuggestion in another clone's mind. \nIt's difficult to read deeper memories, \nconcoct elaborate lies or persuade \nthem to do something they wouldn't \nnormally but you can do it at a pinch."
ANOMALY,5,"Spend 1 Moxie to make things \nhappen. You can't control what \nthose things are – the GM does – but \nthey're generally beneficial to you. \nIn the past, they've been: exploding \nheads, reversed gravity, time dilation, \ngigantism and memory holes. The \nharder you concentrate, the bigger \nthe effect."
CORRODE,3,"Spend 1 Moxie to cause any \nsmall item you're touching to rust, \nrot, corrode and break down \nin 30 seconds. It's difficult to \ndamage large items or ones that \nare further away but you can do \nit at a stretch."
CRYOKINESIS,4,"Spend 1 Moxie to significantly lower \nthe temperature somewhere within \nyour line of sight and create small \npatches of ice, slow down people or \nmachines and so on. It's difficult to \nencase something in ice or lower the \ntemperature enough to do serious \nharm to people but you can do it at \na pinch."
ELECTROSHOCK,8,Spend 1 Moxie to deliver a \ncrackling burst of electricity from \nyour palm that harms humans \nand stuns bots. It's difficult to do \nit at anything longer than handto- \nhand range but you can do it \nat a stretch.
INVISIBILITY,6,Spend 1 Moxie to turn yourself \nand your equipment invisible. \nYou can't turn others invisible. It's \ndifficult to stay unseen for more \nthan a few seconds or if you \nstand in bright light but you can \ndo it if you try harder.
LEVITATION,6,"Spend 1 Moxie to hover up to a \nmetre off the ground and move \nat a walking pace. It's difficult to \ngo higher, or faster, but you can \ndo it with some effort. Levitation \ncan slow or stop falls."
MACHINE EMPATHY,7,"Spend 1 Moxie to cause any bot \nor AI (but not the Computer) \nto like and trust you for the \nremainder of the scene. It's \ndifficult to persuade a group of \nbots, or to do it for longer than a \nscene, but you can do it if you \ntry harder."
MENTAL BLAST,5,"Spend 1 Moxie to let loose a \nmental blast on any clones within \nshort range. The blast can cause \nheadaches and nosebleeds, \nmaybe brief black-outs, up to – if \nyou push it hard – permanent \ninjury or death."
PUPPETEER,5,"Spend 1 Moxie to telepathically \ncontrol a single limb from another \nclone within your line of sight. It's \ndifficult to possess more than one limb \n(say, both legs, if you want them to \nwalk somewhere) or to have them \nperform precise tasks but you can do \nit at a stretch."
PYROKINESIS,4,"Spend 1 Moxie to start a fire \nanywhere close to you. It's \ndifficult to start big fires, do it at \na long distance or set a moving \ntarget on fire, but you can do it \nat a pinch."
STRENGTH,9,"Spend 1 Moxie to activate your \nsuper-strength and lift heavy \nobjects, run faster, jump further, \nhit harder and so on. It's difficult \nto lift really heavy objects or jump \nreally far but if you push yourself \nyou can do it."
TELEKINESIS,7,Spend 1 Moxie to push or pull small \nobjects with the power of your \nmind. It's difficult to move heavy \nobjects (like people) or make precise \nmovements (like pulling the trigger \non a laser pistol) but you can do it at \na stretch.
TELEPORT,5,Spend 1 Moxie to teleport \nyourself a short distance. It's \ndifficult to teleport long distances \nor take others with you but you \ncan do it at a stretch. (You can't \nteleport something 'away' – you \nneed to go with it.)
ADHESIVE,4,"Spend 1 Moxie to secrete an adhesive \nsubstance from your skin that you can \nuse to attach things to other things \n(or yourself to other things). The more \nyou concentrate, the more substance \nyou exude and the stronger the bond \nit can form."
CHARM,5,Spend 1 Moxie to exude a \npheromone that causes one clone to \nlike and trust you for the remainder of \nthe scene. It's difficult to form bonds \nthat last longer or to persuade whole \ngroups of people to trust you but you \ncan do it at a stretch.
